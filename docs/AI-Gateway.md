# DGrid AI Gateway

DGrid AI Gateway provides a single, unified API to access 200+ leading AI models. Users can directly plug their own API keys into tools like Claude Code, Codex, and Moltbot (Clawdbot), which dramatically reduces integration complexity and operational costs.

# Quickstart

DGrid AI Gateway unifies the interfaces of hundreds of AI models. You don't need to handle compatibility adaptations for different models in your code—with a single API endpoint and a standardized API request format, you can freely switch and access all the hundreds of models provided by DGrid.

> The DGrid official SDK is currently under active development—stay tuned for its release. Below are the available temporary request methods to interact with DGrid AI Gateway.

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, you need to:

1. Obtain a valid `DGRID_API_KEY` ([Guide](https://blog.dgrid.ai/posts/2026-01-04/)).
2. Ensure your development environment has network access to `https://api.dgrid.ai`.
3. For SDK usage, install the corresponding OpenAI SDK package in your project.

### Direct API Request via cURL

You can send a direct HTTP POST request to the DGrid AI Gateway endpoint using cURL.

```Bash
curl https://api.dgrid.ai/api/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DGRID_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
  "model": "openai/gpt-4o",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What is the meaning of life?"
    }
  ]
}'
```

### Using the OpenAI SDK (DGrid Compatible)

DGrid AI Gateway is fully compatible with the OpenAI SDK specification. You only need to modify the `baseURL` (and fill in the `DGRID_API_KEY`) to quickly migrate or integrate.

#### Prerequisite: Install the OpenAI SDK

First, install the OpenAI SDK in your project:

```Bash
# For TypeScript/Node.js
npm install openai

# For Python
pip install openai
```

#### TypeScript Implementation

```TypeScript
import OpenAI from 'openai';

// Initialize the OpenAI client with DGrid AI Gateway configuration
const openai = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: 'https://api.dgrid.ai/api/v1', // Point to DGrid AI Gateway endpoint
  apiKey: '<DGRID_API_KEY>', // Replace with your valid DGrid API key
  defaultHeaders: {
    'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>', // Optional: Your application's site URL
    'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>', // Optional: Your application's name
  },
});

// Async function to send chat completion request
async function getChatCompletion() {
  try {
    const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: 'openai/gpt-4o', // Specify the target model (DGrid-supported format)
      messages: [
        {
          role: 'user',
          content: 'What is the meaning of life?',
        },
      ],
    });

    // Print the response result
  console.log(completion.choices[0].message);
}

main();
```

#### Python Implementation

```Python
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize the OpenAI client with DGrid AI Gateway configuration
client = OpenAI(
  base_url="https://api.dgrid.ai/api/v1", # Point to DGrid AI Gateway endpoint
  api_key="<DGRID_API_KEY>", # Replace with your valid DGrid API key
)
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
      extra_headers={
        "HTTP-Referer": "<YOUR_SITE_URL>", # Optional: Your application's site URL
        "X-Title": "<YOUR_SITE_NAME>", # Optional: Your application's name
      },
      model="openai/gpt-4o", # Specify the target model (DGrid-supported format)
      messages=[
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "What is the meaning of life?"
        }
      ]
    )
    
    # Return and print the response content
print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Additional Notes

1. ​**Optional Headers**​: The `HTTP-Referer` and `X-Title` headers are optional, but filling them in helps DGrid better identify your application and provide more optimized service support.
2. ​**Model Naming Format**​: The model parameter uses the format `[provider]/[model-name]` (e.g., `openai/gpt-4o`), which is consistent across all DGrid-supported models for easy switching.
3. ​**SDK Development Update**​: The official DGrid SDK is under development and will provide more native features and optimized performance—please pay attention to the official DGrid documentation updates for release information.
