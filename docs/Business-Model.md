# Business Model: Three-Tier Revenue Model

DGrid’s revenue directly originates from and feeds back into the network’s value creation cycle, enabling sustainable ecological development:

## 1. Core Layer: Protocol Transaction Fees

- Network Transaction Commission (2–10%): Charges a base fee on all AI inference and Agent service requests completed through the DGrid network, forming the core of continuous cash flow.
- Market Service Fees: Collects corresponding service fees for the listing, promotion, and transaction facilitation of models and Agents in the market.

## 2. Expansion Layer: Enterprise-Grade and Value-Added Services

- Enterprise Subscriptions (SLA): Provides high-availability guarantees, private deployment, and exclusive support services for enterprise customers with higher requirements for reliability and privacy.
- Premium API Services: Offers value-added features such as higher call frequencies, exclusive access to models/Agents, and data analysis dashboards.

## 3. Ecosystem Layer: Assetization and Financialization Services

- Staking Service Revenue: Obtains part of the revenue from the staking system of nodes and AI service providers.
- Asset Issuance and Transaction Fees: Provides a platform for the tokenization issuance and transaction of high-quality models and Agents, and collects related fees to capture the upper-layer value of ecological growth.
