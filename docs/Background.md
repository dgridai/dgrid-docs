# Background: Market Pain Points and Industry Gaps

In the current field of artificial intelligence, both centralized systems and Web3 ecosystems face key constraints that hinder the seamless integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain. The AI industry is experiencing explosive growth, yet it lacks both market efficiency and fairness, which restricts the overall development of the ecosystem.

## Market Pain Points: Fragmented Prosperity and Centralized Control

In the current field of artificial intelligence, both centralized systems and Web3 ecosystems face key constraints that hinder the seamless integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain. The AI industry is experiencing explosive growth, yet it lacks both market efficiency and fairness, which restricts the overall development of the ecosystem.

1. **Explosive Supply and Fragmented Ecosystem**: The number of proprietary, open-source, fine-tuned models and AI Agents is surging. However, inconsistent interface specifications and drastic quality disparities make it difficult for resources to interoperate and be compatible with each other.
2. **Matching Failure and Value Obscuration**: For developers, the cost of finding, testing, and integrating suitable models and Agents is extremely high, leading to low efficiency. For creators, excellent models and Agents lack efficient distribution channels, with their value monopolized by centralized platforms, resulting in an imbalanced profit distribution.
3. **Lack of Trust and Concentration of Power**: The service process operates in a "black box" mode—AI output results are neither verifiable nor auditable, and there is no room for autonomous governance. Centralized hierarchies control pricing power and traffic distribution, depriving the ecosystem of transparency and fairness.

The mission of DGrid.AI is to ***"reconstruct the underlying architecture of AI inference"*** by building decentralized infrastructure, freeing AI operations and applications from dependence on a few large platforms. The ultimate goal is to make artificial intelligence a native foundational capability of the blockchain world—seamlessly integrated into blockchain applications, just like current data storage and transaction processing.
