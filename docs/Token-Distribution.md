# Token Distribution

![Token Distribution](/Token_Distribution.png)

The total supply of $DGAI is fixed at 1 billion tokens. Its distribution design aims to align incentive mechanisms among users, node operators, developers, and the broader ecosystem. Tokens enter circulation through structured channels, prioritizing long-term network growth over short-term speculation. The distribution of 1 billion $DGAI tokens is as follows:

- **Nodes (50%)**: By incentivizing Genesis Premium members, Smart Gateway operators, and LLM Providers, we maintain the security and stability of the decentralized inference network. This mechanism adopts a 10-year mining cycle, with mining reward halving events every two years.
- **Community (20%)**: Used to drive developer grants, strategic collaborations, cross-chain integrations, and community initiatives. 30% is unlocked at TGE (Token Generation Event) for pre-mined token redemption and TGE operational activities; the remainder is subject to 2-year linear vesting.
- **Team Incentives (10%)**: Compensates founding engineers and core contributors to ensure long-term team commitment, with a 2-year linear vesting mechanism.
- **Investors (10%)**: Allocated to strategic investors supporting pre-mainnet development. 10% is unlocked at TGE, and the remainder undergoes 2-year linear vesting.
- **Airdrops (5%)**: Incentives related to exchange listings, with 100% unlocked at TGE.
- **Initial Liquidity (5%)**: Reserved for market making on Centralized Exchanges (CEX) and Decentralized Exchanges (DEX), with 100% unlocked at TGE.
