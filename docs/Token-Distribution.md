# Token Distribution

![Token Distribution](/Token_Distribution.png)

The total supply of $DGAI is fixed at 1 billion tokens. Its distribution design aims to align incentive mechanisms among users, node operators, developers, and the broader ecosystem. Tokens enter circulation through structured channels, prioritizing long-term network growth over short-term speculation. The distribution of 1 billion $DGAI tokens is as follows:

- **Nodes (50%)**
- **Community (20%)**
- **Team Incentives (10%)**
- **Investors (10%)**
- **Airdrops (5%)**
- **Initial Liquidity (5%)**

## Positive Ecological Cycle

More Models & Agents Onboarding → Bring More Choices and Better Prices → Increase Payment and Staking Demand → Accelerate Token Circulation Speed and Enhance Scarcity → Strengthen Value Support → Attract More High-Quality Participants → Drive Sustained Network Growth.
