# DGrid Genesis Premium Incentive Mechanism & Rewards Explanation

DGrid has tailored a long-term incentive system exclusively for Genesis Members, with \$DGAI tokens as the core, to achieve value alignment between members and the ecosystem, allowing early supporters to fully share the generous dividends brought by network growth.

### Core Incentives: Genesis Co-Building Rewards

* **tDGAI & IOTX Token Rewards**

During the period of holding Genesis Premium status, members will automatically receive continuous tDGAI & IOTX token rewards without any additional tasks. The total value of the rewards is closely tied to the activity level of the DGrid ecosystem, and will appreciate in tandem with the continuous growth of users, models, and computing tasks within the network, realizing the benefit of ​**"passive income simply by holding Premium"**​.
* **2% Referral Rebate Reward**

Genesis Members are provided with exclusive referral links. After successfully inviting new users to purchase and activate Genesis Premium, the referrer will receive a 2% USDT rebate based on the new user’s purchase amount. Rebates will be credited automatically, and members can view records and withdraw funds in the **[Refer Friends](https://premium.dgrid.ai/referral)** section of the dashboard.

### tDGAI & IOTX Reward Redemption Tutorial

Genesis Members can conveniently redeem tDGAI and IOTX rewards through the DGrid Dashboard by following these steps:

1. ​**Login Verification**​: Log in to the official DGrid Dashboard using the wallet bound to your Genesis Pass, and complete wallet signature verification (no gas fee required).
2. ​**Access the "Genesis Rewards" Section**​: Navigate to ​**"My Rewards"**​. The system will automatically display the redeemable amount of tDGAI and IOTX rewards. After verifying the details, click the **"Redeem"** button.
3. ​**Check Redemption Status**​: Upon completion of the redemption operation, rewards will be distributed to your bound wallet. You can check the arrival status via the **"Redemption Records"** on the dashboard or your wallet explorer.

> ​**Note**​: tDGAI is the test version of DGAI tokens, which can be used to experience various functions on the DGrid test network. IOTX rewards are ecosystem synergy rewards, and can only be redeemed if your Genesis Premium status remains active.
