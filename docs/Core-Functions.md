# The Core Functions of $DGAI: The Four-Dimensional Engine

As the native token of the network, $DGAI undertakes four core functions—staking, payment, incentives, and governance—constructing a positive ecological cycle and driving every key interaction within the DGrid.AI ecosystem.

## Staking and Access

Nodes and AI service providers must stake $DGAI to gain network traffic, establish a reputation system, and ensure network security. Staking requirements are tiered based on node type (node performance), and staked tokens serve as collateral for violating behaviors (e.g., submitting false inference results, downtime exceeding 72 hours). Malicious nodes will face confiscation of 5–20% of staked $DGAI or temporary deactivation; these measures are automatically enforced through smart contracts.

## Payment for Inference Tasks

Users pay with $DGAI via DGrid nodes to access Large Language Model (LLM) inference and Agent services. Fees are dynamically calculated based on the following factors:

- **Compute Unit (CU)**: A standardized metric for measuring inference complexity (linked to model size, number of input tokens, and execution time).
- **Latency**: Adjusted based on task speed (faster execution earns rewards, while latency incurs minor penalties).

Payments are automatically processed through the **Bill Contract**, a smart contract deployed on the blockchain. This contract deducts $DGAI from user accounts and distributes funds to node operators, service providers, etc., ensuring transparency and immutability of transactions.

## Rewards for Node Operators

The network rewards high-quality nodes and AI service providers with $DGAI based on service quality, usage volume, and user evaluations to stimulate enthusiasm for contributions. Operators earn $DGAI based on their contributions to inference tasks (e.g., number of CUs processed, low latency, and uptime). Rewards are proportional to performance—nodes hosting large models (over 13B parameters) or processing high-priority requests receive higher rewards. Rewards are distributed weekly via the Bill Contract, with detailed records archived in the AI DA Layer to ensure auditability.

## Network Governance

$DGAI is a governance token; token holders have the right to vote on key matters related to network development, ensuring decisions align with the interests of active network participants. Proposals include:

- Adjusting the fee structure (e.g., base CU pricing, latency penalties).
- Adding new Large Language Models (LLMs) to the whitelist for network support.
- Upgrading core protocols (e.g., DGridRPC) or settlement rules.
- Allocating treasury funds to promote ecosystem growth (e.g., developer grants, security audits).

Voting power is proportional to staked $DGAI, ensuring decisions align with the interests of active network participants.
