# AI Arena

**DGrid AI Arena** is a dedicated hub inside the DGrid platform where users help evaluate and improve DGrid’s AI models — and earn on‑chain rewards for their contributions.

By completing simple daily “AI Battles” and inviting new users, participants:

* Compare real AI model responses and signal which are better
* Earn points for each decision and referral
* Convert points into **USDT**
* Compete on a **weekly leaderboard** for a shared prize pool

DGrid AI Arena is not just a gamified layer. It is a core component of DGrid’s AI infrastructure that uses community judgment to:

* Evaluate model quality
* Guide model optimization and deployment
* Continuously align DGrid AI with real user expectations

## Key Concepts

#### AI Arena

The **AI Arena** is the entry point within DGrid where all AI reward and evaluation activities take place. It hosts:

* ​**AI Battle**​: daily missions where users compare AI answers
* ​**Points and Rewards**​: tracking of earned points, redemptions, and leaderboard rank

Access AI Arena from the DGrid interface or directly at:
[`https://dgrid.ai/arena`](https://dgrid.ai/arena)

#### AI Battle

**AI Battle** is the main interaction flow in DGrid AI Arena. Users:

* Receive a random question or prompt
* See **two anonymous AI model responses**
* Choose which answer they think is better

Each decision yields points and feeds into DGrid’s model evaluation and training pipeline.

#### Points

**Points** are the internal metric of contribution in DGrid AI Arena. They:

* Are earned by:
  * Completing daily AI Battle missions
  * Referring new users
* Are used for:
  * Direct conversion into USDT
  * Determining share of the weekly leaderboard prize pool

#### Rewards (USDT & Weekly Pool)

DGrid AI Arena rewards participation with ​**real, on‑chain value**​:

* **Direct USDT redemption** based on accumulated points
* **Weekly leaderboard rewards** from a shared **USD 300 prize pool**

## How AI Battle Works

### Daily Missions

* Each user can complete up to ​**5 Daily Missions per day**​.
* Every mission is designed to be ​**quick and intuitive**​, taking only a short moment.
* Missions reset daily, encouraging consistent participation over time.

### Mission Flow

For each mission:

1. **Prompt Display**

* The user is shown a ​*random question or prompt*​.

2. **Two Anonymous AI Responses**

* The prompt is followed by ​**two AI answers**​, each from potentially different models.
* The models are anonymous; only the content of the answers is visible.

3. **User Choice**

* The user reads both answers carefully.
* The user selects the answer they believe:
  * Better fits the prompt
  * Better matches their expectations or needs

4. **Points Awarded Based on Consensus**

* After enough users have voted, a **community majority** emerges for that mission.
* The user’s reward depends on whether their choice aligns with this majority (details in the next section).

### Role in Model Training and Evaluation

Every vote in AI Battle is a **data point** for DGrid’s AI network. DGrid aggregates these user choices to:

* **Evaluate model performance**: Identify which models consistently produce preferred answers
* **Understand user preferences**: What users value in terms of clarity, helpfulness, safety, and relevance
* **Guide model evolution**: Prioritize better-performing models; Inform fine-tuning strategies and deployment decisions

At scale, thousands of daily micro-decisions across many users form a powerful ​**human feedback signal**​, enabling DGrid to:

* Build a more **reliable, human‑aligned AI LLM network**
* Improve robustness across diverse question types
* Move beyond static benchmarks to **continuous, live evaluation**

## Points System

### How Points Are Earned

There are two primary ways to earn points in DGrid AI Arena:

1. **Daily Missions in AI Battle**

* Each mission awards ​**5–10 points**​:
  * **10 points** if your choice matches the **community majority**
  * **5 points** if your choice does **not** match the majority
* There is ​**no “wrong” participation**​:
  * Even if you choose differently from the majority, you still earn points
  * Every vote is treated as valuable feedback
* With ​**up to 5 missions per day**​, users can accumulate points steadily while contributing to model training.

2. **Referral Points**

* Users can invite others to join DGrid AI Arena.
* For ​**each valid referred user**​, the referrer earns up to ​**100 points**​.
* Referrals allow users to ​**scale rewards via community growth**​, not just their own activity.

### How Points Are Used

Your **total points** serve two key purposes:

* **Direct USDT redemptions**
* **Leaderboard ranking and share of the weekly prize pool**

The more points you earn through missions and referrals:

* The more USDT you can redeem
* The higher your relative position on the weekly leaderboard
* The greater your share of the weekly reward pool

## Rewards Model

### Direct Redemption: Points → USDT

Users can convert their points directly into **USDT** at a fixed rate:

* ​**Conversion rate**​:
  * \`1,000 Points = 1 USDT\`
* ​**Minimum redemption amount**​:
  * **1,000 Points** (equivalent to 1 USDT)
* ​**Redemption outcome**​:
  * Once redeemed, USDT is transferred **directly to the user’s wallet** connected to DGrid.

This provides a **clear and transparent** relationship between effort and earnings:

> More missions completed + more referrals → More points → More USDT in your wallet.

### Weekly Leaderboard: Competitive Rewards

Beyond direct redemptions, DGrid AI Arena includes a **Weekly Leaderboard** designed to reward the most active and impactful participants.

* ​**Weekly Prize Pool**​:
  * **USD 300** per week
* ​**Distribution Mechanism**​:
  * Top participants share the **USD 300** pool
  * Rewards are ​**proportional to weekly points earned**​:
    * The more points you earn in that week
    * The larger your share of the **USD 300** pool

### Reward Structure Summary

* **Casual users**
  * Earn via consistent daily missions
  * Can convert points into USDT over time
* **Power users & top contributors**
  * Benefit from both:
    * Direct USDT redemption, and
    * Additional income from leaderboard rewards

This **dual reward mechanism** ensures that all participation is recognized, while also ​**incentivizing sustained and high-impact engagement**​.
