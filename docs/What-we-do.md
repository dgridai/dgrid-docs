# What We Do

With the core mission of **"building a trusted, efficient AI network connecting supply and demand"**, DGrid addresses the industry pain points of market fragmentation and centralized control. We break down the fragmentation and value mismatch in the AI ecosystem, providing a one-stop solution for both Web3 and traditional AI sectors. Adhering to the core principle that **"AI should serve the open web"**, we are committed to enabling high-quality AI capabilities (including LLMs and AI Agents) to achieve efficient flow, fair distribution, and trusted verification through technological innovation and ecosystem collaboration.

To tackle the core challenges—such as the explosion of model supply alongside fragmented interfaces, high integration costs for developers, value monopolization of creators, and non-auditable inference results—DGrid has built a three-tier architecture: **"Decentralized Routing & Verification Network + LLM & Agent Free Market + AI DAO"**, which connects the entire chain from AI capability supply to demand matching:

- Through a unified API and intelligent routing, we resolve interface fragmentation. Developers can access thousands of models and Agents without redundant development, significantly lowering integration barriers.
- We build a trusted inference environment using the **Proof of Quality (PoQ)** algorithm, enabling verifiability and traceability of AI execution processes and output results, and bridging the trust gap in Web3 AI.
- We establish an open LLM & Agent free market, allowing creators such as model providers and prompt engineers to set their own prices and profit directly from global users, breaking platform monopolies.
- Via a distributed node network and elastic scheduling mechanism, we address the high costs, single points of failure, and censorship risks of centralized AI, while providing a merit-based incentive system for node operators.

Ultimately, DGrid aims to become the **"value hub"** of the AI and Web3 ecosystems. We not only deliver cost-effective, verifiable, high-quality AI services to users but also build a fair and win-win collaboration platform for ecosystem participants, advancing AI from **"centralized services"** to a **"foundational public utility of the open web"**.

## Core Values

- **Decentralization**: AI belongs to the open web, not centralized platforms, ensuring equal participation of all ecosystem stakeholders.
- **Accessibility**: Anyone can join as a node operator, developer, creator, or user, with low barriers to entry.
- **Trustlessness**: Based on on-chain permission and auditing mechanisms, services are verifiable and traceable without relying on third-party trust.
- **Scalability**: Modular design enables flexible model deployment, inference, and caching, adapting to diverse scenario requirements.
- **Value Discoverability**: Intelligent routing makes inference resources "routable, verifiable, and comparable in price", enabling efficient allocation of intelligent liquidity.
