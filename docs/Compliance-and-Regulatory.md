# Compliance and Regulatory Requirements Statement

## Compliance with Regulation S Obligations

The sales plan for the DGrid Premium License is strictly implemented in accordance with the relevant provisions of the U.S. Regulation S. **Participation in this plan by U.S. persons is strictly prohibited**. This participation restriction will be prominently indicated on the official sales website, all promotional materials, and user interfaces. Potential participants must carefully read these compliance requirements and clearly understand that: **the DGrid Premium License may not be transferred, resold, or subject to any form of secondary circulation within twelve (12) months after the completion of the initial issuance**. Violation of this provision will be deemed a breach of compliance obligations.

## Principle of Transparent Information Disclosure

All communications, marketing material production, promotional activities, and social media postings related to the sale of DGrid Premium shall be based on the core principle of openness and transparency. At the same time, **targeted marketing or sales messages to U.S. persons are strictly excluded**. In the process of releasing relevant information, all content expressions that may involve U.S. targets will be fully avoided to ensure compliance with Regulation S standards and effectively reduce regulatory risks. Meanwhile, participants shall independently verify the relevant regulatory provisions of their respective jurisdictions, assume sole responsibility for compliance review, ensure that their participation is fully in line with local legal requirements, and avoid risks arising from violations of regional regulatory provisions.
